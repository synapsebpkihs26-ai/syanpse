# Synapse 2026 – Frontend

This repository now contains only the public-facing React frontend for the Synapse 2026 college fest site. It includes the event highlights, registration info, category detail pages, and supporting UI components built with Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

The compiled assets will be emitted to the `dist` directory for deployment to any static hosting provider.
