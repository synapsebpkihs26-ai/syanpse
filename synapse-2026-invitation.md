# ABOUT DHARAN

Dharan is a city in Koshi Zone, Sunsari district, eastern Nepal—an ex-Gorkhas city of unity in diversity. It lies right at the foot of hills, with a dramatic transition from the Terai. At a distance of 540 KM from Kathmandu, the city is rich in diverse culture, religion, natural beauty, and modern development. Beautiful roads, remarkable homes, and natural beauty are not all that makes Dharan. It embraces cleanliness, openness, friendly hill people, and their smiles. The population mainly consists of Mongolian origins. Dharan is famous for temples, scenery, and cleanliness.

## Dharan Town
Some of the terrific features of the city, a queen of Eastern Nepal, have attracted domestic and international tourists in the thousands each year. Bhedetar hill, all season cold, in the north of the city is popular among domestic and Indian tourists. The view tower and Charles Point are popular for viewing the whole hill, mountain, and the Terai of the eastern region. A total view of Dharan, Itahari, and Biratnagar towns is possible from these points. The Tamor and Saptakoshi rivers running from the north and west border of Dharan have always been the dream of courageous rafters for white water rafting and bathing.

## Dharan is famous for
B. P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, over 25 temples and holy sites, and scenery that makes it one of the important pilgrimage destinations of Nepal. Dharan is also the gateway to Nepal's popular tea-growing region, Dhankuta. It is known as an environmentally friendly city and a land of friendly hill people with smiling faces.

## How to reach Dharan
From Itahari, Dharan is only 20 minutes by bus. Itahari is well connected to all other cities of Nepal. Anyone can come to Itahari and then take a micro van or a bus to Dharan. There are direct long-distance bus routes from Kathmandu and Pokhara.

## What to see and do
Temples like Dantakali, Budhasubba, Pindeshwori, Panchakanya are places you shouldn't miss. Budhasubba is famous for bamboos that don’t have tips. Couples write their names on the bamboo with the belief that they will have a long relationship. While you are in Dharan, do not miss rafting from the Tamor River to the Koshi.

Bhedetar (Sheep's Butte) is a beautiful hillside about 15 km (and straight up) from Dharan. It marks the end of the Terai (plains) and the beginning of the foothills of the Himalaya. There are a number of lodges along the way providing a nice view down to the south.
